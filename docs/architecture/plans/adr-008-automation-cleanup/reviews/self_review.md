# Self-Review Report

## 1. Objective Checks
- [x] Did I confirm the branch? (Yes, `main`)
- [x] Did I define the scope? (Yes, ADR-008, architecture docs, roadmap)
- [x] Did I avoid interpretation? (Yes, stuck to file contents and explicit status)
- [x] Is the report actionable? (Yes, clear lists of files to remove vs. update)

## 2. Quality Checks
- **Specificity**: Did I name specific files? (Yes, e.g., `arch-behavior-003-autopr.md`)
- **Evidence**: Did I cite sources? (Yes, referenced ADR-008 content and file paths)
- **Completeness**: Did I miss anything critical? (Covered the main "Cleanup" and "Scanner" aspects. `issue-kit` internal structure changes are implied by the doc updates.)

## 3. Conclusion
The Reconnaissance Report is valid and ready for the Analysis/Planning phase.
