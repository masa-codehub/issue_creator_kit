# Self-Review Report (Goal Setting)

## 1. Quality Checks
- [x] **Specific**: Is the goal clear? (Yes, "Establish execution plan", "Generate Issues")
- [x] **Measurable**: Are verifications concrete? (Yes, file checks, grep)
- [x] **Achievable**: Is it realistic? (Yes, standard planning process)
- [x] **Relevant**: Does it serve the user's request? (Yes, "Plan refactoring")
- [x] **Time-bound**: implied immediate.

## 2. Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Missing some dependencies in the plan.
- **Mitigation**: The `scouting-facts` report was thorough. I will use it to populate the `design-brief.md` update.

## 3. Conclusion
Goal is SMART and ready.
